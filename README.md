# DISCLAIMER

I've build SScHat - pronounced 'shat' (the 'c' is silent) - for fun. It's intent being an experiment and nothing else. SScHat should **not** be considered a serious and reliable (communications) tool. I strongly advice against using SScHat in any scenario aside from personal interest.
